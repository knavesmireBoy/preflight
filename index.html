        <div><p>After several years of maintaining a long distance relationship, my partner and I attempted to resolve the situation and I spent half the year in Sydney.</p><p>Things didnâ€™t work out at that time, but I did find work at Alias a design/repro company in North Sydney. Their blue-chip clients demanded stringent pre-flighting routines for the adverts that would run in national newspapers, supplements and magazines. The experience encouraged me to better organise the job assets and on my return I developed a pre-flight check list primarily to help new repro recruits navigate the minefield of digital output.</p>
